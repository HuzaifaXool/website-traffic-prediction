## Introduction
This document presents an in-depth analysis of website traffic data with a primary goal of predicting conversion rates. The analysis encompasses diverse traffic sources, such as organic, social, paid, direct, and referral, to derive valuable insights for optimizing website strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is stored in `website_traffic.csv`, which includes various metrics related to website traffic activities.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA step provides insights through visualizations such as boxplots, bar charts, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships of the variables related to conversion rates.

## Models
### Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression is implemented to gauge its effectiveness in predicting conversion rates based on the features extracted from the dataset.

### Polynomial Linear Regression
A polynomial linear regression model is also utilized to capture potential non-linear relationships in the traffic data, providing a comparison against the conventional multiple linear regression model.

## Evaluation Metrics
Performance of the models is evaluated using the following error metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared**
- **Adjusted R-squared**

## Results
The analysis demonstrates that the polynomial regression model outperforms the multiple linear regression model across all metrics, achieving lower error values and higher R-squared values, indicating a better fit to the data.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis reveals critical insights into how different traffic sources influence conversion rates. The polynomial regression model's superior performance highlights the importance of considering non-linear relationships in website traffic dynamics.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To execute the analysis, run the Python script after ensuring that the `website_traffic.csv` dataset is in the same directory. The script will generate visualizations and output the performance metrics of the regression models.
